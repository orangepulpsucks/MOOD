      "The image captures a woman with shoulder-length, wavy, blonde hair, smiling gently as she turns to her right, her gaze not directly at the camera but slightly away. She is wearing a simple, dark-colored top, which stands in contrast against the soft, natural background blurred with bokeh. The lighting suggests it's either sunrise or sunset, lending a warm golden hue to the scene, particularly highlighting her hair and the right side of her face. Behind her, the suggestion of lush greenery and distant trees evokes a sense of being outdoors in a serene, possibly garden-like environment.\n"
